This repository hosts the table of final high redshift candidates found within the JWST JADES dataset. Below are the details on what each column of the repository contains:

1. Object Number: Serial Number for the galaxy candidate
2. RA_hms: RA of galaxy candidate in HH:MM:SS format
3. Dec_hms: Dec of galaxy candidate in DD:MM:SS format
4. Z_BEST: Best photometric redshift determined by LePHARE
5. Z_BEST68_HIGH: Upper bound on best fit photometric redshift
6. Z_BEST68_LOW: Lower bound on best fit photometric redshift
7. Flux_f090w, Flux_f115w, Flux_f150w, Flux_f200w, Flux_f277w, Flux_f356w, Flux_f410m, Flux_f444w: Meausured flux [MJy/sr] of object in 8 JWST NIRCam filters (F090W, F115W, F150W, F200W, F277W, F356W, F410M, F444W)
8. Hainline: 'HN' means that this galaxy appears in the published [Hainline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02468) catalogue
9. Whitler: 'WT' means that this galaxy appears in the published [Whitler](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00984) catalogue
